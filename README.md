# Virtual-Assistant


Virtual Assistant is a web-based application designed to enable users to control their
computer or phone using their voice. This application combines voice recognition, speech
synthesis, and camera functionality to perform a range of tasks without needing to manually
interact with the device.
Using Web Speech API, the application can recognize voice commands and respond by
speaking back or by executing actions. This includes opening popular websites (like YouTube,
Google, Instagram, or WhatsApp), searching for information on the internet, or retrieving the
current time and date.
